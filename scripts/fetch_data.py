#assuming that we have already connected to the data base, we fetch this data:
#Hospital_Expire_Flag: Binary variable indicating whether the patient died (1) or survived (0)
#during the hospital stay.
#My predictors are:     #
#Gender: Categorical variable indicating the patient's gender.
#Age_at_Admission: Numerical variable representing the patient's age at the time of hospital admission.
#ICU_Length_of_Stay: Numerical variable indicating the length of the patient's stay in the ICU, in days.
#Admission_Type: Categorical variable indicating the type of admission (e.g., EMERGENCY, URGENT, ELECTIVE).
